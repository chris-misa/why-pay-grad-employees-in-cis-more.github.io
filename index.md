# There are lots of reasons to pay us more!

<div align="justify">


*(This page is in draft mode. We are working to solidify the best possible language/framing, format it nicely, include meaningful graphics, provide links to sources, etc. However, even in this unfinished state, it gives you the gist of where our heads are.)*

We've gathered data to support a number of arguments. In the end, they all point to one thing: salaries need to be raised.

Our arguments are these. If even one is persuasive, it stands to reason that pay should be increased.

1. Existing compensation isn't competitive when measured against peer institutions. Our department is in the bottom ~10%-25% of all computing departments nationwide in terms of pay offered.
2. We have seen pay cuts in the last two years, in real terms, and we want our salaries back.
3. Rental costs, in particular, have become so high relative to pay that we can't afford housing anymore.
4. Pay is so low that, even going by the University of Oregon's own official cost-of-living estimates, we can't afford rent and groceries.
5. There is real human suffering in our department because of the lack of living wages -- not just gripes about lower than desired salary. It's to the point that many of us can no longer ethically recommend graduate study in our department to potential new graduate students (esp. PhD students who are here for multiple years).
6. We are not asking for a lot of money. And there is plenty of money in the budget to pay us a bit more. To not pay us more is a policy decision, not a budget constraint.
7. There is a lot of precedent at the University of Oregon for our request. Graduate employees in many other departments make hundreds of dollars a month more than we do.
8. Raising our pay is bennificial for the State of Oregon as a whole.

As a reminder, gross median pay for GEs in our department was ~$1,889/month ($17,001/academic year) for entry level employees and overall gross median monthly pay was ~$1,967/month ($17,703/academic year) in 2020-2021.

*(TODO: Refactor below WHEREASes into section-based supporting arguments for the points listed above.)*

We are resolute in our conviction that pay must be raised, for all of the following reasons:


1. WHEREAS the graduate employees of the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Oregon teach undergraduate classes in their own right, direct laboratory sections for up to 75 undergraduate students a term, create new assignments for undergraduates, grade undergraduate work, conduct novel research on the edge of human knowledge and understanding in the field of computing, and write and win external grants alongside their senior colleagues: the tenured professors, tenure-track professors, and career instructors of the department;
2. WHEREAS, for a typical graduate employee in the Department of Computer and Information Science in 2020-2021 working 18-20 hours a week, in addition to full time graduate study, the median gross monthly pay was ~$1,889 for entry level employees and overall median gross monthly pay was ~$1,967;
3. WHEREAS the median health insurance premium paid by the university for a graduate employee in the Department of Computer and Information Science is a $504/month;
4. WHEREAS typical net monthly pay for a graduate employee in computer science at all levels of experience is approximately $1,500, give or take $50 to $100 depending on the exact tax situation and nominal hours worked (that is to say, an overall income tax rate of 20-25%);
5. WHEREAS health insurance paid by the university for the most typical graduate employee (i.e., single individual in their late 20s/early 30s) is comparable with plans offered on the open market (we found that a comparable zero-deductible plan for a single individual in their late 20s/early 30s living in Eugene offered through Kaiser Permanente + Healthcare.gov was $418/month, but the plan does not offer vision nor dental benefits, which would likely bump up premiums by another $80 or so, and would then match the GTFF healthcare plan price);
6. WHEREAS the health insurance premiums for graduate employees paid by the university are historically among the lowest of all employee groups on a per-employee basis;
7. WHEREAS the price of housing in Eugene has skyrocketed in the last year, such that landlords are raising rents at or near the amount permitted by Oregon’s statewide rent control law (over 9%);
8. WHEREAS the University of Oregon does not have the will nor the capacity to house all graduate students at a subsidy in university owned housing, and has itself both raised rent multiple times and infamously moved to evict some of its graduate student tenants in good standing in the last few months, including tenants working for the Department of Computer and Information Science;
9. WHEREAS the median monthly rent for a 1-bedroom apartment in the Eugene-Springfield metro area now exceeds $1,000;
10. WHEREAS less than $500 a month ($16.70/day) of discretionary after-rent income is not enough to buy food and basic essentials in Eugene for one person, let alone a family;
11. WHEREAS the University of Oregon itself acknowledges all of these expenses, reporting the following estimates on its page https://financialaid.uoregon.edu/cost_of_attendance_graduate :
 * Monthly Housing Costs: $1,070;
 * Monthly Food Costs: $341 (which we believe to be an underestimate)
 * Books and Supplies: $1,158
 * Personal Expenses: $2,196
 * Transportation: $1,308
Which, when added together, correspond to average expenses of $1,929/month, nearly exceeding the gross pay offered by the department, and certainly more than the ~$1,500 net pay hitting our wallets;
12. WHEREAS nationwide inflation at 5.4% in June, its highest point since the 2008 financial crisis, is confounding the financial difficulty;
13. WHEREAS the paltry 1.4% cost of living adjustments negotiated by the university-wide graduate employee labor union two years ago no longer make sense in today’s context;
14. WHEREAS the new Letters of Appointment (contracts) for graduate employees in the Department of Computer and Information Science sent out by the university for the 2021-2022 academic school year reflecting this meager 1.4% pay adjustment, and not a penny more, is intolerably low;
15. WHEREAS graduate employees hold bachelor’s and master’s degrees in computer science, a closely related field, or otherwise have backgrounds which have prepared them for graduate study in the field of computing;
16. WHEREAS the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 2020 median annual salary for software developers with a bachelor’s degree was $110,140, and, for computer research scientists with master’s degrees, $126,830, thus creating a compelling financial reason for graduate employees at all graduate levels of computer science to eschew academic study for far more lucrative jobs elsewhere;
17. WHEREAS the vast majority of graduate employees in the Department of Computer and Information Science at the University of Oregon have forgone years of lucrative salaries elsewhere to commit themselves to teaching, research, and general scholarship;
18. WHEREAS pay has gotten so tight that some graduate employees in the Department of Computer and Information Science are discreetly taking additional flex jobs in order to make ends meet, such as picking up occasional fast food shifts and doing gigwork like Uber or Lyft driving, none of which is conducive to teaching, research, or progress towards the graduate employee’s own graduation;
19. WHEREAS graduate employees who cannot take on additional work are particularly impacted by unlivable pay, such as carers of young children, people with certain disabilities, or international students who are generally prohibited from working for employers other than the university as a condition of their visas;
20. WHEREAS 91% of Oregon parents desire more computer science educational opportunities for their children;
21. WHEREAS there is a severe shortage of qualified computing professionals in Oregon, including business software developers, data scientists, web designers, app creators, network administrators, computing research scientists, and computer science teachers;
22. WHEREAS a bipartisan group of representatives of the Oregon State Legislature introduced a bill in 2019 declaring an emergency with respect to computer science education in Oregon (House Bill 2967);
23. WHEREAS the Oregon State Legislature has allocated some $900 million to Oregon’s public universities over the next biennium;
24. WHEREAS undergraduate enrollment and tuition numbers for the upcoming academic year appear to be promising, and returns from the university’s savings through its $912.5 million endowment and other investments are considerable;
25. WHEREAS the University of Oregon has recent success in grants and donations, both with respect to the Department of Computer and Information Science specifically, and to the university more broadly, with the Knight’s second $500 million dollar gift dedicated to applied science coming to mind;
26. WHEREAS all parties are in agreement that graduate employee salary levels at the University of Oregon are low on their face, and compared to peer institutions;
27. WHEREAS neither immediate supervisors nor the department head set pay levels for graduate employees, but as compensation decisions are made by the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences Bruce Blonigen (annual salary: $565,000) or their designee the Divisional Dean for Natural Sciences Hal Sadofsky ($313,500) with some input from the VP for Finance and Administration & CFO Jamie Moffitt ($407,400), the Provost Patrick Phillips ($615,200), and ultimately President Michael Schill ($1,235,400), to them we thus direct this petition;
28. WHEREAS months of less public, behind-the-scenes lobbying for livable pay by various graduate employees in the Department of Computer and Information Science with university officials in budget-setting leadership positions has been fruitless;
29. WHEREAS we are proud of our university, our department, our earned degrees, our students, our faculty, and the caliber of academic rigor provided by our labor;
30. WHEREAS many of us can no longer recommend graduate study in computer science at the University of Oregon to potential doctoral and master’s students due to the scarcity of graduate employee positions and the unlivable pay provided by those positions that do exist;
31. WHEREAS the average starting pay for graduate employees in other departments is hundreds of dollars more a month, including in the departments of Art History, Biology, Chemistry, Creative Writing, Earth Science, Economics, Mathematics, Physics, and Psychology, and, further, the Department of Computer and Information Science’s graduate employees have lower average overall pay than graduate employees in an additional 18 hiring departments;
32. WHEREAS the livelihood and graduation of approximately 50 graduate employees (approximately 25 teachers and 25 researchers) and their families is at stake here;
33. WHEREAS median gross pay in academic year 2020-2021 was $16,767 for GE1s and $17,700 overall;
34. WHEREAS the Taulbee survey, the gold standard for enrollment and salary statistics for academic computing departments, reported the following for academic year 2020-2021:

35. WHEREAS the salary demand in “A.” places de-facto starting salary at $21,060;
36. WHEREAS the salary demand in “A.” is estimated to cost the university an adjustment of no more than $253,000, of which roughly half is expected to be paid for by external grants (i.e., not from undergraduate tuition nor state tax allocation); is less than a 0.15% overall shift in the College of Arts and Science’s budget, a rounding error in the context of the university’s overall budget of nearly a billion dollars; and simply adjusts entry level pay for graduate employees in the Department of Computer and Information Science to be in the same ballpark of the Departments of Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and computing department peers elsewhere; with 15% raises upon completion of major academic milestones, in line with industry standards;

## RESOLVED: The people in budget setting authority positions must boost graduate employee salaries in the Department of Computer and Information Science.
